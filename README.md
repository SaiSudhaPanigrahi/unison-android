# What's Unison?

Unison is the code name behind **GroupStreamer**. It's a group music recommender
for parties and gatherings: it picks out the best music on your Android device
given the people around you.

It's basically a mobile interface to the Unison back-end, which is also [hosted
on GitHub][4].


## Dependencies

The app currently depends on these external projects:

- [ActionBarSherlock][1] for an implementation of the action bar on
  pre-Honeycomb devices.
- The [Support Package][2] which is needed by ActionBarSherlock.
- [Gson][3] for JSON serialization / deserialization.


## I want to test it!

The app is not yet available on Google Play, although we should get there soon.
If you want to test it in the meantime, please [contact me][5].
