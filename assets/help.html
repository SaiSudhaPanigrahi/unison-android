  <h1>GroupStreamer</h1>
  <p>
    GroupStreamer is a music recommender system for parties and gatherings: it
    picks out the best music on your Android device given the people around you.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a short tutorial on how to use it. Enjoy !
  </p>

  <h2>Basic scenario</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine you are hosting a party. You and hopefully a few of your guests have
    the GroupStreamer app on their phone. One of you will create a <em>group</em>
    for the party, and all of you will join the group. You will then decide on
    one person that is providing the music&mdash;i.e. the <em>DJ</em>. This
    person will plug his phone into loudspeakers and start playing music through
    GroupStreamer.
  </p>

  <p>
    GroupStreamer tries to select the music according to the preferences of
    everyone in the group. It starts by guessing your tastes from the music
    library on your phone, but it always tries to improve the recommendations by
    looking at signals such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the ratings you and your guests give,</li>
    <li>if a particular song gets skipped.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In order to get more precise recommendations, we encourage you and your
    guests to give as much ratings as possible.
