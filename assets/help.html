  <h1>GroupStreamer</h1>
  <p>
    GroupStreamer is a music recommender system for parties and gatherings: it
    picks out the best music on your Android device given the people around you.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a short tutorial on how to use it. Enjoy !
  </p>

  <h2>Basic scenario</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine you are hosting a party. You and hopefully a few of your guests have
    the GroupStreamer app on their phone. One of you will create a <em>group</em>
    for the party, and all of you will join the group. You will then decide on
    one person that is providing the music&mdash;i.e. the <em>DJ</em>. This
    person will plug his phone into loudspeakers and start playing music through
    GroupStreamer.
  </p>

  <p>
    GroupStreamer tries to select the music according to the preferences of
    everyone in the group. People's musical tastes are automatically inferred
    from the contents of their music library.
  </p>

  <h2>The groups list</h2>
  <p>
    This screen shows you the groups that are nearby. Often, you'll first want
    to <em>create</em> a new group. You can then ask your friends / guests to
    <em>join</em> the group you've just created simply by touching its name.
  </p>

  <h2>The music player</h2>
  <p>
    The main screen is the music player. If you want to provide the music for
    the group, you can grab the DJ spot (it's first come, first served).  You'll
    be then presented with a standard media player bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not the DJ, you can still see which song is currently playing.
    You can also give a rating on the current song, which will help
    GroupStreamer make more precise recommendations in the future.
